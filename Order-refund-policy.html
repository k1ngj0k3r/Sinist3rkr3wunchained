<h1>Order & Refund Policy</h1>

<h2>🌊 1. General Order Policy</h2>
<p>Thank you for supporting <strong>Sinist3rKr3w Unchained</strong>! All of our merchandise is created with care and shipped via Printful. By placing an order, you agree to the following terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All sales are final unless otherwise stated.</li>
  <li>Orders placed with a free coupon or at $0 are treated as test or promotional orders and may remain listed as “unfulfilled” in your Payhip account. These do NOT require shipping and do NOT affect actual paid order status.</li>
  <li>Physical products are shipped within <strong>5–7 business days</strong> after your order is placed. Delivery times vary based on location and carrier availability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>⚡️ 2. Refund Policy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Refunds are granted only for defective or damaged items upon arrival. Contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of receiving your item, with a photo of the damage, to request a replacement or refund.</li>
  <li>We do not offer refunds for change of mind or incorrect sizes after an order has been placed. Please review the product description and size chart before making a purchase.</li>
  <li>Free coupon/test orders are NOT eligible for refunds or replacements, as no transaction was made for these items.</li>
